# Who Are we?

Kastel is our open-sourced chat platform, designed to foster community engagement and meaningful connections. Much like Discord, Guilded, and Revolt, we're here to empower our community by actively seeking and incorporating your valuable feedback.

Our commitment? We're in it for the long run. Kastel plans on remaining open-sourced, with plans to introduce optional end-to-end (E2E) encryption for both direct and group messages. Just like Discord, we'll also welcome bots onto this platform.

We prioritize your experience, which is why you won't find intrusive ads here. Instead, we aim to introduce subscriptions and donation options to sustain our platform.

Behind the scenes, our tech stack is robust. We utilize Typescript for the backend, including WebSocket, Content Delivery Network (CDN), and APIs, with Bun as our runtime. On the frontend, we use Svelte with Tailwind CSS for our styling.

At present, our dedicated team consists of three passionate individuals. Kastel is not just an app; it's a community-driven endeavor. Join us and be part of something special.
